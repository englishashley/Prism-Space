### Prism Space | AI Training in Orbit

Exploring the feasibility of real-time AI model training in orbit using federated learning across satellite constellations.

---

## Project Overview
Prism Space is focused on advancing space-based AI computing infrastructure, enabling autonomous learning and edge processing in orbit. 

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook simulations analyzing the power and cost tradeoffs for federated learning (FL) using optical inter-satellite links (OISLs).

### This work supports Prism Space’s mission to:
- Develop scalable satellite-based AI training architectures.
- Optimize compute efficiency in orbit while minimizing power consumption.
- Leverage federated learning & distributed AI to reduce data transmission costs.

## Key Features
Power Consumption Analysis – Calculates training power requirements for different FL architectures.  
Cost-benefit optimization – Identifies the optimal number of sats where power savings justify launch  
OISL bandwidth impact – Simulates the effect of inter-satellite links on training efficiency.  
Scalability testing - Evaluate how increasing the **number of satellites** affects power efficiency.

Power vs. Cost Tradeoff (Key Takeaways)
- Training AI models on a single satellite is infeasible due to extreme power demands.
- Federated learning distributes AI training, reducing per-satellite
